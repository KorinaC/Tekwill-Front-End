<p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
<p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

<h2> <strong>What is HTML?</strong></h2>

<p>
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).    
</p>

<p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. 
Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
</p>

<p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>The opening tag</li>
<li>The closing tag</li>
<li>The actual element</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3> 

There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:

<ul>
<li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
<li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
<li> To build web applications</li> 
<li>To impress friends</li>
<li>To have fun &#128515; </li>
</ul>

Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!
